# Landing Page

## Project Goal

This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page. To complete the project will mostly require modifying the js/app.js file, as well as modifications to the index.html and css/styles.css files to further update and customize.

## JavaScript

This landing page demonstrates the use of Javascript to manipulate the DOM.
